We’re conducting a study aimed at predicting alcohol consumption trends based on key economic indicators. We will 
analyze alcohol consumption data from 85 regions in Russia during the years 1998-2016. Our datasets contain info on
the sale of wine, beer, vodka, champagne, and brandy per capita, per year, and per region. We will analyze total 
alcohol consumption by region and by type. We will also consider the unemployment rate and GDP in Russia during the
years 1998-2016 to determine if there are any correlations with the amount of alcohol consumed.

## Projected Analysis
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 What alcohol type is consumed most in Russia? Does preferred alcohol type/strength 
vary by region in Russia? 

 How does alcohol consumption change with economic/unemployment changes? 

 Does preferred alcohol type consumption vary with economic/unemployment 
conditions? 

 Can we predict alcohol consumption based on unemployment rate in the future
(linear regression)?

 Does alcohol consumption per capita change based on region latitude (linear regression)?
